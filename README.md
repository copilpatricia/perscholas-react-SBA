# SBA - Rick and Morty API

## Description

I created an application using the API documentation from Rick and Morty API.
I made a Nav Component for the title. The name of the font family that I used is "Honk" and can be found here : [Honk](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Honk).

In the application you will find different characters displayed on the Card components with the following information:

1. Name of the character
2. Image of the character
3. Gender of the character
4. Location of the character
5. Origin of the character

I used the useEffect hook to connect to the external API: [Ricky and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/) and useState hook to store the data from the API.

I installed the React Bootstrap library to use the bootstrap card in order to have a flexible content container.
